# Swift Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of key data structures and algorithms implemented in Swift, following modern Swift practices. The goal is to build these implementations from the ground up, offering clarity and insight into their core principles.

---

## Overview

Leveraging the latest features of Swift, this project presents custom implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. The code is organized into a modular structure to facilitate easy learning, maintenance, and experimentation.

---

## Folder Structure

- **src/**  
  Contains the main source code for the data structures and algorithms. Each component is organized into its own module or folder for a clean, modular approach.

- **Tests/**  
  Houses unit tests that validate the correctness and performance of the implementations.

## Build and Run Instructions

This project is configured to work with CMake. To build and run the project:

**Using CMake:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake build
   ```

Make sure you have Swift installed and updated to the latest version.

## On Windows

Currently, static linking of the library on Windows machines causes error at linking stage and is bogus. Hence, please use WSL for building and testing this library. Only make sure to install Swift Development Toolchain under your WSL installation.

---

## Usage Rights

The code in this repository is shared in the spirit of free education. **Please do not use this code directly for academic assignments or professional projects.** Instead, use these implementations as a source of inspiration to develop your own solutions and deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
